            <h1>Freeride MTB</h1>

            <p>
                <strong>Freeride</strong> is a discipline of mountain biking
                closely related to downhill biking, dirt jumping, and freestyle
                BMX. When riding a freerider focuses on tricks, style, and
                technical trail features.
            </p>

            </p>
                Freeride is now recognized as one of the most popular
                disciplines within mountain biking.

            <p>
                The term freeriding was originally coined by <em>snowboarders</em>,
                meaning riding without a set course, goals or rules on natural
                terrain. In mountain biking, it is riding trail with the <strong>
                most creative line possible</strong> that includes <strong>style</strong>,
                <strong>amplitude</strong>, <strong>control</strong>, and <strong>speed</strong>.
                Many in the cycling industry suggest that the <em>Laguna Rads</em> were the
                first to freeride, that is riding terrain that didn't already have an
                existing path or network of trails.

                    <h3>Frame</h3>

                    <p>
                        The frame is made usually of aluminium alloys and/or steel,
                        and usually smaller build compared to a downhill bike.
                        It is also equipped with rear suspension systems, and
                        many manufacturers still rely on simpler systems
                        i.e. single-pivot) in order to preserve strength and
                        uninterrupted suspension travel.

                    <p>
                        Single crown forks are now more popular.
                        Companies such as Fox, Answer Products (Manitou),
                        Marzocchi and RockShox, introduced them with very
                        similar strength to their dual crown counterparts,
                        with the immense advantage of being a single crown.

                    <h3>Gears</h3>

                    <p>
                        Freeride mountain bikes are often geared differently to
                        downhill or other mountain bikes. There are three main
                        types of freeride mountain bike gearings, these are
                        single speed, short range and long range. Single speed
                        mountain bikes use a single chainring at the front, mounted
                        to the cranks, and a single sprocket at the rear, normally
                        mounted to a freewheel or a freehub.
